# Envelope Sequencing
Package (?) for HIV-1 env plasmid sequencing analysis with optim_assembly. Uses pcDNA3 as a backbone vector and HXB2 as refernce strain. 

## EnvSeq.sh

## optimassembly.py
`optimassembly.py` is from ozagrodi

`pcDNA3_bb.fasta` is the reference for the plasmid (backbone only!)
`HXB2.fasta` is the reference for HIV-1
